🚖 OLA Rides Data Analytics Project

📌 Project Overview

The OLA Rides Data Analytics Project focuses on analyzing ride-sharing data to uncover insights about customer behavior, revenue trends, cancellations, and vehicle performance.
Using Excel, SQL, and Power BI, I transformed raw ride data into meaningful dashboards that support business decisions in operations, customer experience, and revenue growth.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Excel → Data cleaning, formatting, and preprocessing.

SQL → Querying, aggregations, and advanced analysis.

Power BI → KPIs, interactive dashboards, data storytelling.

📂 Data Source

Dataset inspired by real-world ride-sharing platforms, containing:

Ride ID, Date & Time

Customer & Driver IDs

Ride Distance, Duration, Fare

Vehicle Type (Mini, Sedan, Prime, etc.)

Payment Method

Booking Status (Completed, Cancelled by Customer/Driver)

Vehicle Rating (1–5 scale, provided by customers)

📊 Key Business Questions Answered

What are the Total Bookings, Total Revenue, and Average Fare per Ride?

How many rides were cancelled by drivers vs. cancelled by customers?

Which vehicle categories (Mini, Sedan, Prime, etc.) bring in the most bookings and revenue?

What is the average customer rating for each vehicle type?

Which days, times, and cities see the highest demand?

What are the cancellation patterns and how do they affect revenue?

📈 Features & Highlights

1. SQL Queries

Aggregate queries to calculate Total Bookings, Revenue, Avg Fare.

Conditional queries to split cancellations by customers and drivers.

Window functions to rank top-performing vehicles & drivers by ratings.

CTEs and joins for analyzing ride distribution across cities and vehicle types.

2. Power BI Dashboard

KPI Cards: Total Bookings, Total Revenue, Avg Fare, Cancellation by Customer, Cancellation by Driver.

Ratings Overview: Average rating per vehicle type (Mini, Sedan, Prime).

Trends: Bookings by weekday, peak demand hours, monthly growth.

Performance Page: Revenue by car type, cancellations breakdown, ride completion % by city.

Filters: City, Car Type, Payment Method.

💡 Insights & Business Impact

High Demand Windows: Evenings and weekends had the most bookings—suggesting targeted promotions.

Revenue Drivers: Sedans and Prime cars generated higher revenue despite fewer rides compared to Minis.

Cancellations: Customer-driven cancellations were higher than driver-driven ones, indicating pricing or wait-time issues.

Vehicle Ratings: Prime rides had the highest customer satisfaction ratings, highlighting a quality-driven preference.

Retention Strategy: Improving cancellation handling and incentivizing drivers could reduce lost revenue.


🚀 Future Enhancements

Add driver performance metrics (avg trips/day, acceptance rate).

Integrate real-time data pipelines with Python.

Predictive analysis for surge pricing and ride demand.
